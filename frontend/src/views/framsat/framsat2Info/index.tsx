      missionTitle: `FramSat is a satellite-based platform made to 
        demonstrate the tech of bleeding-edge space technology. FramSat 
        is Orbit NTNU's partner program, where we're using our bus and 
        systems, funded by a sponsor for the mission where we will test 
        and verify their technology in space. By developing our own 
        in-house systems on volunteer hours, we are in a unique position 
        to launch payloads that would not be affordable on commercial 
        options. Orbit NTNU has developed this tailored mission system 
        in-house and will take part in the historic first launch from 
        European soil. Orbit NTNU is a crucial part of the new space 
        industry and New Space by having the lowest industry costs while 
        still outperforming yesterday's solutions. Developed entirely 
        by students, the satellites comprise several advanced subsystems 
        needed for tomorrow's space civilization.`,
      missionTextLeft: `We're excited to present another groundbreaking 
        partnership opportunity in the FramSat program. By fully funding 
        the costs associated with creating and launching FramSat-2, the 
        sponsor will be paving the way for a project with enormous potential 
        rewards for a very low cost compared to building one themselves or 
        elsewhere. We will use and increase our knowledge in satellite 
        development, integration, testing, and operations to make the 
        mission a success. Our first project, SelfieSat, shows our track 
        record. It is currently in space, and we've successfully established 
        communications and can even retrieve cool images from space. This 
        showcases our dedication to executing a project from idea to 
        operation.`,
      missionTextRight: `Our primary goal with this mission is to 
        educate our members. Our technical members are aspiring space 
        engineers and will gain practical experience through the mission, 
        becoming potential assets to your future workforce. But this 
        collaboration is also a big opportunity for your company to 
        conduct cost-effective research and development. Testing your 
        equipment in the challenging conditions of outer space comes at a 
        fraction of the price compared to deploying a standalone satellite, 
        like mentioned before. Beyond R&D, this project offers a platform 
        to demonstrate the durability and efficiency of your technology, 
        effectively strengthening your brand. It's a win-win situation for 
        everyone involved.`,
