        The FRAMSat missions is a satellite-based platform to demonstrate the
        tech of bleeding-edge Norwegian technology. FRAMSat-1 is Orbit NTNU's
        first partner mission, where we have provided our bus and systems for
        our partner Eidel, to test and verify their sun sensor. By developing
        our own inhouse systems on volunteer hours, we are in a unique position
        to launch payloads that would not be affordable on commercial options.
        Orbit NTNU has developed this tailored mission system in-house, and will
        take part in the historic first launch from European soil.

        The launch will be performed by our partner, ISAR, and be a the next
        step for the new space race. Orbit NTNU is a crucial part of the new
        space industry and New Space, by having the lowest industry costs while
        still outpreforming yesterdays solutions. Developed entirely by
        students, the satellite comprises several advanced subsystems needed for
        tomorrow's space civilization. The mission is set to launch from And√∏ya
        in late 2022 and is the foundation for the new Norwegian space
        adventure, bringing space closer to home.
